# For-Python-beginers
This repository consists of all the python projects for the beginners and who wants to grow their career as Data Analyst/Scientist or currently studing Data Science

This is very basic but very important project to get hands on "Machine Learning".
I created a psuedo dataset of 20 rows of music["Age", "Gender", "Genre"] This is a very small dataset but will give you insight of machine learning algorithms. A layman would be able to undertsand about this process.

In this project we will be doing:
1. How to import csv file using pandas library 
2. Divide the dataset in to two datsets so that we can use 1 as an input and the other as output
3. Build a classifier model for the dataset
4. Prediction of the model
7. Further divide the datset in to training and test dataset
8.Check accuracy of the model
9. Model presisitance and loading ( so that we dont have to build the model again and again)
10. Build decision trees using Graphviz 
11. How to create a dot file and visualize in VSC
12. How to import a picture in to your Jupter notebook

Good Luck! ;)
